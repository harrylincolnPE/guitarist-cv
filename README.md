# guitarist-cv 🎸

Hiiii! 👋

My name is Harry, I'm a London-based software developer that has been playing in bands since my teens. 
I'd like to think I have a bunch of influences, ranging through later 20th century greats - Marr, Frusciante, George Benson (I'm a total sucker for melody!) - to newer more out-there slingers like Omar Lopez Rodriguez and Ezra Koenig.

I have several qualifications in music and music theory - can sight-read chord charts & tab, can jam most things if I know the key or hear enough of what's going on, and generally voice in a few positions fairly quickly.

Recent bands and projects I have written for have been of the post/indie rock vibe:

I'm known to shout sometimes and hold a tune - I wouldn't call them strong skills but I'm sure with enough practice... Here's an old band doing a fairly silly cover of a Spice Girls tune!
